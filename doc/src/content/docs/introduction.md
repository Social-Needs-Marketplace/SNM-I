title: Introduction
---
The focus of this project is on finding a more efficient and effective ways of
providing goods and services to vulnerable populations, such as those who live
below the poverty line, are infirm, or are seniors. Being vulnerable means
doing without goods and services due to lack of funds, lack of social support
networks or limited mobility.

Our approach is to develop an online marketplace called the Social Needs
Marketplace (SNM). It will provide a more efficient means of redistributing new
and used goods and services by enabling the “demand” side to make known their
needs, and the “supply” side to make known what they have available.

Using Artificial Intelligence methods such as ontologies, constraint-based
reasoning and machine learning, the SNM will discover what people have and need
and suggest matches. The SNM will also address the logistical problem of
transporting goods from the supplier to the consumer within the time windows
the people are available. It will provide a volunteer/agency supported
logistical system utilizing an Uber-like volunteer network. Thirdly, the SNM
will enable more efficient use of NGOs by virtually combining and focusing
their resources to achieve better outcomes.

## Benefits of SNM-I
Clients, service providers, funders and policy makers are the stakeholders and
beneficiaries of this system.

A major benefit of this project is the impact it will have on the quality of
life of the vulnerable. The flexible and nimble provisioning of basic needs
reduces the stress of many segments of our population. Reducing stress provides
a better quality of life.  A better quality of life results in better workplace
performance and productivity.
- **Clients:** SNM-I can benefit clients by helping to shape and support an
  efficient and effective service delivery system. SNM-I can assist by
  facilitating expedited intakes, client problem and goal elicitation, need
  assessment and service planning, making and tracking referrals.
- **Service Providers:** SNM-I can help providers quantify and qualify what
  they do. It can be a tool to easily access information on who is seeking
  services, clients served, services provided, needs met as well as and help
  find out determinants of client success and what aspects of each program and
  service are most fruitful. Perhaps programs are doing better with a
  particular sub-population and this may be an opportunity to better cater
  services toward another sub-population they are already serving; or perhaps a
  significant percentage of people who receive a certain type of service
  management in terms of identifying worker case loads and frequency of worker
  interaction with clients. SNM-I can expedite program intakes and help monitor
  progress and completion, while ensuring critical data is captured that can be
  used to shape the delivery system and better best clients.
- **Funders and Policy Makers:** Data captured via SNM-I deployments can be
  used to quantify and qualify what a community is doing to reduce the
  incidence, duration and prevalence of social issues over time. It can help
  identify the success of prevention strategies, perform service gaps analysis,
  and conduct Point-in-Time-Counts.
