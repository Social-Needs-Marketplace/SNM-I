The objective of the Social Needs Marketplace - Impact (SNM-I) is to find efficient
and effective ways to provide goods and services to vunlerable populations.
This includes sernios, the infirm, and those below the poverty line. In the
scope of this project "vulnerable populations" refers to those who cannot
acquire goods and services due to limited mobility, lack of funds, or 
lack of social support networks.

The SNM-I project serves as an efficient tool to redistribute goods and services
that allows the "demand" side to declare their needs, while the "supply" side
declares what is available.

Using artificial intelligence methods such as ontologies, constraint-based
reasoning and machine learning, the SNM-I will consider both resource needs
and availability to suggest possible matches. The SNM-I will also aid in coordinating
time windows for the delivery of goods, addressing logistical issues between
suppliers and consumer availability. Additionally, the SNM-I will provide a 
volunteer/agency-supported logistical system utilizing an Uber-like network.
The SNM-I will also enhance the efficient use of NGOs by virtually merging and 
concentrating their resources to attain improved outcomes. 

## Benefits of SNM-I
Clients, service providers, funders, and policy makers are the stakeholders and
beneficiaries of the SNM-I project:


* **Clients:** The SNM-I benefits clients by enhancing the efficiency and efficacy 
of acquiring aid as they are able to find resources tailored to their needs
more easily. The project can also assest in facilitating expedited intakes, client problem
and goal elicitation, needs assessments, service planning, and making or tracking referrals.


* **Service Providers:** The SNM-I allows providers to easily quantify and qualify
the extent of their services. The project serves as a tool to easily determine
clients seeking services, clients served, and provided services. The SNM-I may also 
help in determining factors in client success, and what aspects of each program or service
is most effective. For example, consider a program that is more effective or used more
frequently by a sub-population. By using data collected from the SNM-I, providers
can aim their program to further gear their services to that specific sub-population.
Additionally, the SNM-I can aid in service management, as worker case loads and frequency
of client interaction are considered. The SNM-I can expedite program intakes, and aid in 
monitoring program progress and completion, all while ensuring that critical data is captured 
to further improve the delivery system and better serve frequent clients.



* **Funders and Policy Makers:** Data captured by the SNM-I can be used to quantify
and qualify how a community is working to reduce incidence, duration, and prevalence
of social issues over time. Ths project can identify possible success factors in
prevention strategies, perform analysis on potential service gaps, and conduct 
Point-in-Time-Counts.
